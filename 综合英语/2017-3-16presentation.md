Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I am 史鸿梭，from Japanese dapartment. Thank you very much for coming along here today. I hope you'll find my presenttion interesting. The purpose of today's presentation is to take a introduction about Japanese traditional light poetry, Waka. First I'd like to introduce what is Waka. Then, I want to introduce my favourate Waka. I'd be very happy to invite you to ask questions at the end of the session and I'm sure there'll be plenty of time for us to discuss some of the points that have been raised.

The word waka has two different but related meanings: the original meaning was "poetry in Japanese"; the later, more common definition refers to Tanka, means Short poem, a poetry in a 5-7-5-7-7. And today I want to introduce about the later, Tanka. Let us compare the Waka to the Haiku: 

Waka has 31 syllables, and Haiku has 17 syllables.
Waka is 5-7-5-7-7, and Haiku is 5-7-5.

I think you'd better to read the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu if you want to learn more about Waka. The Ogura Hyakunin Isshu is a classical Japanese anthology of one hundred Japanese waka by one hundred poets. The Hyakunin Isshu, means one hundred poems and one hundred poets.

And then, I want to introduce about my favourate Waka, is the 15th poem of Ogura Hyakunin Isshu. The poet wants to give some green herbs to 'you', and send him or her this poem. 君がため春の野に出でて若菜摘むわが衣手に雪は降りつつ。 It is for your sake, that I walk the fields in spring, Gathering green herbs, While my garment's hanging sleeves ,Are speckled with falling snow. 

And who is 'you'? His brother? His friend? I think he gave this poem to his grilfriend, his sweatheart. Let us imagine it: The early spring, the snow, the wind, the new leaves, the flovers, I went out to pick green herbs, for you. What a wonderful awesome beautiful poem.

This is the end of my speech. thank you very much for being here.
これで私の発表を終わらせていただきたいと思います。ご清聴ありがとうございました。
