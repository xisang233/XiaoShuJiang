Hello, laedys and gentlemen. I am 史鸿梭，from Japanese dapartment. On monday my friend Mrs.Xu introduced about haiku, a Japanese traditional light poem.  And today I want to intoduce about another Japanese traditional light poem. It name is waka.
こんにちは、日本語学部一年の史です。月曜日、徐さんが日本の俳句について発表したんですが、本日は和歌について発表したいと思います。では始めます。

The word waka has two different but related meanings: the original meaning was "poetry in Japanese"; the later, more common definition refers to Tanka, means Short poem, a poetry in a 5-7-5-7-7 metre. And today I want to introduce about the later. Let us compare the Waka to the Haiku: 

Waka has 31 syllables, and Haiku has 17 syllables.
Waka is 5-7-5-7-7, and Haiku is 5-7-5.

I think you'd better to read the Ogura Hyakunin Isshu if you want to learn more about Waka. The Ogura Hyakunin Isshu is a classical Japanese anthology of one hundred Japanese waka by one hundred poets. The Hyakunin Isshu, means one hundred poems adn one hundred poets.

And then, I want to introduce about my favourate Waka, is the 15th poem of Ogura Hyakunin Isshu. The poet wants to give some green herbs to 'you', and send him or her this poem.
